Michael Chan 	11 Jan, 2022 	2nd 	Got to the approach snow slope only to realise I had forgotten Jess’ crampons. Giving her mine, she and George went off to start the route whilst I left my bag and went back to Aviemore to pickup the forgotten crampons. Moving with haste I made my way back, and to my delightful surprise see George just finishing up the route. Howling into the storm to declare my readiness and excitement, I made my way over to join Jess at the belay missing out of none of the fun! George ticked off a bucket list route and Jess dispatched her first ever Scottish winter route with style.

stevo smith 	7 Jan, 2022 	AltLd O/S 	A Great Climb 😎👍 A couple of tricky sections. Tho with enough gear placements & wide enough to get stuck in. It feels comfortable enough to not be too much of a dramatic experience. A steady rap off down the face next to the Slit itself. Taking care of others. Thankfully we had it all to ourselves. Done in two pitches. Ross went first.

tbm 	10 Mar, 2020 	- 	Pretty lean. Lots of ice in the cracks to make gear difficult (barely any cams would hold) but also useful for climbing. I had to rest on my axe on the second pitch due to getting pumped above marginal gear. Pretty cold conditions all day with the wind blowing snow straight up the route. I missed the finishing point and did an extra pitch which led to stuck ropes when abseiling. Amazing route with very enjoyable techy climbing. Sustained all the way up. But always manageable with regular good feet.

Gavin McColl 	9 Nov, 2019 	AltLd β 	2hr wait to get on. Harder than I expected. Very sustained and focused climbing due to the delicacy of axe and crampon placements. Gear very good and I made full use of it! Completed in 2 pitches and abbed down. Jack lead pitch 1 which we both agree is the crux. I lead the second and logest pitch from the first (smaller) chockstone onwards. Extremely good route and obvious why this is such a classic. Will Definetely be back for another ascent. Bags must be left at bottom if climbing inside crack. 60m half ropes make it to the bottom from the obvious chockstone at the obvious top out.

joe.91 	12 Dec, 2015 	AltLd O/S 	Epic! Lead pitches 1 and 3, going behind the chock was memorable! Left behind a red hex on the second pitch, wedged in pretty good. Would like to have it back but doubt I will!

Teappleby 	21 Feb, 2015 	AltLd O/S 	First Grade V, so psyched! The plan had been for Micki to lead the first pitch but he thought he'd only done half of it when he stopped as he could see the chockstone above. So when i seconded he "finish off" his pitch and it turned out the crack wasn't as long as we'd though and we'd already done the crux chockstone and this was pitch 2! So from then on we alternated up 3 and 4. Great Leading by Micki on the crux and generally a great route!
with MSchobitz
MSchobitz 	21 Feb, 2015 	AltLd O/S 	Great and strenuous climb! Got very 'involved' in the crack. Led P1,2,'4' and Tom led P3. Thought the crux was the first section of the crack.

jamiefoxen 	1 Mar, 2014 	Lead O/S 	More of a archaeological excavation than a climb. Powdery in the chimney, but some nevi at bottom. Thick verglas on the chimney walls and verglas and some hoarfrost on walls either side, making gear very hard to find or excavate. Some better gear opportunities emerged on top pitch as the verglas thinned. Overall totally brilliant climb!
